In 2015 Boffi and De Padova reach an agreement for the integration of the two companies. United in a shared vision which aims to create a design platform of fully integrated and complementary excellence: from bathrooms to beds and storage systems, from kitchens to upholstered furniture and accessories. The operation will make Boffi and De Padova collaborate very closely for the development of a strong internationalization already undertaken by both companies, with the main aim of supporting the ""Italian know-how"" in the world by forming a group with capillary penetration in both residential and contract divisions. More than 60 mono-brand stores in 60 countries worldwide. They are in charge of sharing the Boffi communication and sales strategies with qualified in-house team capable of transforming the aesthetic and functional requirements in optimal and customised solutions. Each project approaches the uniqueness of custom-made tailored through the customization of shapes, sizes and materials. Objective: to characterise Boffi as a ""single"" and unique brand of the ""Made in Italy"". The story of Italian design is also a little history of the Boffi family. Under the wise direction of the three ADs Luigi Massoni, Antonio Citterio and Piero Lissoni, many designers participated thanks to their different background and knowledge. Built in over 50 years of work, the prestige and credibility of the brand take off since 1980, helped by the communicative efficacy of sophisticated photographic catalogs and technical manual. The promotion of events from creative and cultural worlds reinforces Boffi's identity: an example, the pioneering trend of leaving the fair during the Salone del Mobile in Milan to choose representative locations in the city. It is the beginning of a new phase which finds energy and inspiration in the artistic direction of Piero Lissoni. It was 1934 when Piero Boffi founded his company. Since then a lot has changed: social conventions, lifestyles and aesthetic sensibility, however in over 80 years Boffi and its activity could express the changes in taste and technologies, making it always synonymous with innovation and design worldwide."

The uniqueness of Giorgetti lies in its capacity to make quality and innovation parts of its life. A Giorgetti ambient never appears as an aseptic space, devoid of personality, on the contrary it transpires elegance, sobriety and decisiveness. Its furnishing style can be immediately identified and defined as ‘the Giorgetti style’, unique and original, characterised at the source by its atypical uniqueness. These values materialise into products that dismiss the ordinary to create exclusive and versatile solutions, in the respect of a refined and unmistakable character that seduces by the beauty of its contrasts. Thanks to the passion for detail, high intrinsic quality in terms of technology and materials, but also the quality of the design that makes every element unique of its kind, pieces free from formal conventions can be created that exist happily side by side anywhere, cancelling cultural and temporal distances. The products manufactured by Giorgetti are a prime example of Made and Manufactured in Italy. Starting from design, creativity and style, up to the actual production, the entire production process is entirely made in Italy by highly qualified personnel having great skills in the furniture sector. Giorgetti products are functional and made of long-lasting quality materials and are made with eco-friendly efficient technologies. The Made in Italy artisan production surpasses the logic of the standard product and guarantees a high level of product customization. The cabinetmaking tradition, together with technological progress, established a heritage which is dependable and can be trusted to source and process the best materials. Giorgetti creates functional, contemporary pieces with an unmistakable style, integrating the highest artisanship with woodworking tradition, a long-time characteristic of the company, with the use of sophisticated tooling machinery and the most modern product technologies. The innovative machinery used in producing the Giorgetti collections allows the wood to be shaped while respecting its nature, as well as guaranteeing an absolute precision in the details. Add to this the irreplaceable work of the artisans and you have Giorgetti products that possess the allure of unique handmade pieces. The final product is born from a rare and precious approach to craftsmanship; at the same time, innovation is constantly applied to the manufacturing techniques with the aim of improving the woodworking and the attention to detail Our products are drawn from processing techniques tied to cabinet work traditions and the use of state-of-the-art technologies; this allows us to make quality products that maintain their own distinctive characteristics. Therefore, any apparent irregularities – such as differences in colour, in the structure, in the size and materials that they are made of – are not to be considered defects, rather peculiarities that make the product unique and special. Rigorous quality controls are made on the entire production line. During their machining the raw materials are subjected to thorough quality and performance tests at every step. The finished product undergoes an accurate performance test and an equally thorough comparison test is made with its original design. Living the Giorgetti space means knowing precious materials, loving innovation and tradition, choosing a unique and personal style, knowing how to present something which tells its own story. Elegance is the summing of ‘pleasure and value’ Giorgetti's life could be summarized using two terms: quality and Made in Italy TRADITION AND INNOVATION CARE OF MATERIALS a story long over a century"

102,FLOU SPA,779080969,Monza e della Brianza,Lombardia,25552326,Sistema ARREDAMENTO,media,"Back in 1978 Vico Magistretti designed Nathalie, the original modern textile bed: innovative in terms of type, esthetics and performance, it marked a watershed moment in the history of furniture.The design of Nathalie was an elegant stylish revolution and dramatically changed the taste orientation of a discerning public.And even today it is unrivalled. The Flou base with electric movements comes with a remote control that changes the position of the head, the back, and the legs in order to achieve a personalised level of relaxation, and to read, use a tablet or a computer, and watch TV in the most comfortable position. Here you can find all the Flou Linens and ask for an estimate. Select the size of your bed and start to set up. The Flou System contains a number of elements that, when combined, ensure the maximum degree of wellness during sleep. Flou periodically publishes a general catalogue that describes and shows the several types of products in its collection, designed for the sleeping and living quarters.The general catalogue is available in hard copy and can be downloaded from this section. This annual series of catalogues is a platform that allows Flou to present the very latest additions to its collection of products for the bedroom and the lounge, with the company’s personal interpretation of the latest trends and styles.

It was the year that Flou was founded, a company with the precise objective of innovating the bedroom and create a new ‘sleep culture’.It was a period of great social change: more women were going out to work, the homes required multi-functional spaces, there was the growing desire to live life with greater freedom and higher quality. The bedroom became somewhere more dynamic and the bed abandoned the traditional static all-white appearance and delighted dressing in colors.Flou was ahead of its time and launched Nathalie, a bed designed by Maestro Vico Magistretti. In addition to the innovative design and the possibility of purchasing it ‘ready for sleep’, Nathalie was also extremely practical: a flick of the wrist and it was made.The success of Nathalie is history and this creation is now considered to be the mother of all ‘modern textile beds’ which then became a furnishing division in its own right – soft, upholstered, removable covers, washable, a place where the sheets and bedcovers were replaced with brightly-colored duvets.Flou had arrived and its continual development saw esthetics and function going hand-in-hand with innovation in the field of materials, technology, rationalization of the production processes. However, the company philosophy remained unchanged: to produce excellent beds, designed with the precise objective of improving comfort, wellness and quality of life.At the time of writing, Flou is producing more than 50 different beds, from single to king-size, from sofa-beds to studio couches, produced with fabrics, wood, leather, hide and other materials. The company also produces the technical accessories – mattresses, pillows, mattress supports, cover fabrics – duvet covers available in a wide range of colors and patterns, collections that are reviewed every year; furnishing accessories – chests-of-drawers, night-stands, occasional furniture, desks, armchairs, mirrors, lamps, poufs and bookcases.The collection is completed and enriched with the extraordinary wardrobes of the Guardaroba range; some of the doors connect and match with the textile soul of the company. Thanks to this innovative concept, Flou has been able to interpret the ‘sleep culture’. It is now a market leader in the sector and has been promoted from being the ‘bed specialist’ to the ‘bedroom specialist’.The complete collection is available in the leading furniture stores in Italy and across the world, and in the Flou showrooms in Milan and New York. Sadly, the founder of Flou, Rosario Messina, left us prematurely on March 9th 2011.He used these words to describe the body and soul of Flou:“The bed is a special place where the future is born, where couples connect, where families are created, where people think about their tomorrows. That is my opinion today as it was when I founded Flou all those years ago”.His extraordinary professional career and human experience was recognized with the maximum tribute by the President of the Italian Republic who nominated him as Cavaliere del Lavoro in June 2008.He was born in 1942 in Aci Castello, Sicily. His father, a farmer, died young and his son Rosario assumed the responsibility of his family. At that time, he was employed in the ‘La Rinascente’ department store in Catania; however, his work did not prevent him continuing his evening classes and he successfully graduated from High School. He changed jobs and worked for the Catania branch of Zanussi-Rex, the leading Italian company for electrical appliances at that time.He moved to the north of Italy where he was appointed as sales manager for a prestigious design company. He was then employed in the commercial department of another leading furniture company, which like the previous one, was located in the industrious Brianza area.These professional experiences were invaluable for his career and he changed positions again, working in the Italian textile company Bassetti where he was involved in the development of new concepts for the application of textiles in furniture production.The year 1978 saw a major development: with some partners, he founded the company Flou which he later acquired in full.Intuition, drive, foresight, an innovative spirit are the characteristics that allowed the Sicily-born Rosario Messina to make his mark in Lombardy, historically recognized as being the stronghold of famous design companies. The City of Meda, where the Flou headquarters are located, paid tribute to his commitment by welcoming him as an Honorary Citizen.His successful career has been marked by numerous prizes and awards, including “Compasso d’Oro ADI for his career”; the “Entrepreneur of the Year” awarded by Ernst & Young; the “Made in Italy Awards, New York”; the Medaglia d’Oro Confindustria Monza (the Gold Medal awarded by the Industrial Confederation of Monza); the “Piazza Mercanti” prize awarded by the Milan Chamber of Commerce; he was appointed as a Board member for the Industrial Association of Monza and Brianza; the Rotary prize “Paul Harris per l’Imprenditoria” and he took part in numerous conferences, forums and congresses where Flou was presented as an emblematic example of innovation in furniture design and production. In the Nineties, he reached the height of his career in the trade associations, with appointments as President of the Furniture Group Assarredo, President of Assarredo, President of Cosmit, the organizing committee for the Milan Furniture Salon. During his two terms of office, the International Furniture Salon consecrated Milan as the world’s design center. In 2008, he was elected President of Federlegno-Arredo, the Federation that represents 2300 entrepreneurs of the trade associations in the furniture-furnishings industrial division.Rosario Messina also had roles of institutional importance such as Consigliere del Consiglio di Indirizzo della Fondazione Centro Sviluppo Rapporti Italia-Russia (Board member on the Foundation for the development of Italy-Russia trade relations); he was a member of the National Steering Committee and the Board of Confindustia; Confindustria nominated him Vice-President of CFI – The Industrial Exhibitions Committee; he was a member of the Board of Directors of the Angelo De Gasperis Foundation.In 2008, he was nominated ‘Grande Ufficiale dell’Ordine al Merito’ by the Italian Republic; the following year, Italy’s President nominated him as ‘Cavaliere del Lavoro’ – the country’s highest honor.

After researches driven by passion and expertise the first collection was born in spring 1996 and it was entirely manufactured in Italy thanks to the existing industrial facilities owned by the family; it was the result of the enthusiasm and collaboration between Laura and the designer Andrea Parisio, art director of the brand. In the same year the collection was shown in the first atelier in Milan together with a rich textile range – a distinguishing feature of the brand since its dawn.The successful first showing and the excellent feedback received by insiders and customers led naturally, in year 2000, to the creation and promotion of the first official collection as Meridiani.Thirty years of experience previously acquired in manufacturing high quality furniture paddings and upholstered beds turned out to be one of the primary elements that contributed to the success of the new brand.In 2016 the company joined IDB - Italian Design Brands S.p.A. - with the goal of strengthening an already important presence of its brand on international markets and developing synergies in innovative areas through digital transformation processes, shared commercial strategies and new distribution channels."" HOME: timeless collections, elegant and without frills, essential but still vivacious, modern but with no compromises with temporary trends. A distinguished style, an inspiring new classic that leaves space for personal interpretation. Furnishings for the living room, the bedroom, the dining area, the library and the outdoor: meticulous signs, precise proportions, essential volumes. Indoor and outdoor collections recall each other also in the details, the precious materials and in the crafts. It’s about the need to feel that the indoor space becomes one with the outdoor one and that elegance, continuity and a thread bind them forever in time.Precious textiles, textures stolen from the richest wardrobe: natural fibers such as linen, cotton, velvet and chenille, elegant threads transformed in couches, beds armchairs and chaise longues. The softness of full grain leather and the strength of hide are emphasized by seams inspired by the art of saddlery."" Born in Lodi in 1964 Andrea Parisio, art director and designer of MERIDIANI, attended the European Design Institute in Milan and graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Pavia. After a rich experience in designing residential and commercial spaces, in 1996 Parisio joined the company and cooperated with Laura Ferraro Crosti, when opening the first store in Milan, a space / laboratory of ideas, in which his designs were born and showcased, giving life to a home collection. A collection that, over the years, has expanded and consolidated, while maintaining a clear direction: the desire to create a range of contemporary products which did not betray the lesson of the past and could give rise to a ‘timeless’ collection, able to assimilate the new trends and transcend the whims of the more extreme design. As an artistic director Parisio coordinates the brand image, designs the corporate showrooms and stores and the exhibition settings at the international furniture shows. Andrea Parisio lives and works in Milan."" Each original MERIDIANI product is the result of the use of the best materials and careful quality controls: expertise and attention to detailing are carried out by artisans who perfectly complement the mechanized processes. A love for handcrafted furniture, legacy of the region in which the company was born and works, which has been conveyed to industrial production.

158,ZANOTTA SPA,695980961,Monza e della Brianza,Lombardia,16106441,Sistema ARREDAMENTO,media,"Established in 1954, Zanotta is one of the recognized leaders in Italian industrial design since ever. Guided by the insight and wonderful entrepreneurship abilities of the founder, Aurelio Zanotta, starting from the 1960s it won and has held the international spotlight, thanks to its products: these are emblematic from the viewpoint of formal innovation as well as of technological research, aiming at a continuous evolution in the materials quality and in the production processes. The cultured and precious history of Zanotta is renewed in 2017 thanks to the union with Tecno, launching a common project for the two brands with the consequent strengthening of international synergies and commercial strategies under the leadership of Giuliano Mosconi, President and CEO of the two brands.
 Today, many of these iconic silhouettes, inflected with more than a note of irony, continue to reflect the larger-than-life spirit of the brand’s founder and namesake, Aurelio Zanotta, a consummate businessman with an instinctual flair for injecting beauty, ingenuity, and whimsy into daily life. Incorporating the lessons of rigorous material and formal R&D, his is a recipe and legacy that has conquered the vicissitudes of trend and promises to withstand the test of time.Among the original progenitors and standard bearers of Italian furniture design—the intrepid canaries when home furnishing was little more than a utilitarian cave—Zanotta has carved out an all but untouchable place in the ranks of contemporary luxury. The first to grace its catalogue with works by some of the industry’s boldest names, in sixty years Zanotta’s amassed a veritable pantheon of award-winning designs, with almost a fifth residing in permanent museum displays.
 The story of Zanotta is of one intuition —of risk taking, curiosity, reward and, above all, accomplishment— written over six fruitful decades. In that span, the brand has churned out a staggering total of 550 designs, with almost a fifth residing in permanent collections at the most prestigious museums and institutions around the world, represented by 330 individual pieces.
 And while its position in the pages of design history becomes ever-more rarefied, Zanotta’s creations are intended for much more than collecting dust behind glass walls and velvet rope. Every piece, rather, is deliberately designed for active enjoyment in daily life.
 Founded on the philosophy that culture and profit aren’t at odds; convinced that the furniture industry mustn’t simply bend, passively, to public demand, but must actively anticipate future needs; and espousing both exceptional form and uncompromising function, the Zanotta company and catalogue remain true originals.
 “Zanotta simultaneously represents both the past and the present of international design...The brand expresses a vision of the world, a philosophy that has always strived to go beyond the present in order to identify languages and products able to speak ‘forever.’ In its catalogue Zanotta has many lifelong bestsellers. This is evidence that if you work well, the past is never a burden, but an opportunity.”Aldo Colonetti
 Quality of materials, always premium; of production technologies, invariably cutting edge. Then there’s quality of performance, encompassing a product’s safety and durability over time—which Zanotta evaluates via thorough endurance tests, assessing compliance with the strictest industry regulations as well as the brand’s own high standards.
 Of course, there’s also the unrivaled quality of Zanotta’s craftsmanship—the pride and artisanal expertise showered lovingly on every product— and apparent in details and finishing and the maximization of inherent material beauty. Of no less importance—but perhaps implied—is Zanotta’s quality of design, the formal excellence of products shaped by the deftest hands in contemporary design to serve as models and points of reference for the entire industry.
 At Zanotta, quality also extends to after-sales service and support—represented by the brand’s uncompromising commitment to ensuring satisfaction over time, and special “made-to- measure” service, wherein spare parts, specific coverings, and other types of maintenance are available for years after the initial purchase. And finally, there’s quality as it relates to spirit and soul of the brand itself, and its sense of obligation and commitment to the design community. Zanotta is a founding member of Altagamma, an association that, since 1992, has championed excellent Italian design on the international stage.
 Production takes place mainly within Zanotta’s Nova Milanese factory, encompassing 16,000 square metres and 90 employees, half of whom are skilled artisans engaged directly in manufacturing—and particularly in the processing of leather and fabrics for upholstered items.
 Assembly and finishing operations are carried out for certain models of chairs, tables, accessories and various furniture items created by the most technologically-advanced suppliers in Italian production, largely operating in Northern Italy. As such, Zanotta production is 100% “Made in Italy”.
 The commercial distribution is supported by 4 Flagship Stores and more than 800 selected resellers, with a presence in over 60 countries and a quota of exports exceeding 80% of turnover.
 An evocative and emotional space that tells stories of cities and journeys, inviting visitors to discover the Zanotta living scenarios: the furnishings, selected from the brand's icons and the most recent collections, become interpreters of one discreet, refined, rigorous, always modern and recognizable style through a path that unfolds room by room.Caselli DaziariPiazza XXV AprileMilano"

 Futuristic design, or that is what the Elda Armchair would look like for observers from the 1960s or 1970s. This very special piece is a historic product from the creative mind of Joe Colombo. It was one of his first, but though it was designed in 1963, production did not start until 1965. And it is named after his wife, Elda, of course. On display at the “Museum of Modern Art” in New York and the “Louvre” in Paris, Elda is considered to be an authentic design object by art and design enthusiasts. Elda was one of the first furnishing objects in which the plastic is strengthened with glass fibre. For the Elda armchair, Colombo decided to abandon the usual wood frame (used for all armchairs of that time). Taking inspiration from boat hull technology, he obtained a lightweight and resistant composite material. The Longhi - IN&OUT collection presents similar examples of fiberglass such as the Astrea armchair, also by Joe Colombo (1963); the full swivel Rodica armchair by Mario Brunu (1968); and the more recent Dolcevita.
 It is located within the industrial complex of Meda, headquarters of the company. An area of <U+200B><U+200B>about 1320 square meters on two spacious and bright floor.

International Office Concept, IOC, since 1992 is an independent division of LEMA. Benefiting from the know-how of its ""parent company"" acquired by making Italian design history, IOC develops specialist projects for professional workspaces.
Within this reality are the irreplaceable qualities of a ""family"" company that has become a global industry and that guarantee high ethical values of work, respect for the environment, attention to materials, artisan knowledge of manufacturing, high technology of processes and strategic vision of the future.
These qualities are multiple and aim at the primacy of the project, product excellence and service optimisation. IOC is able to create total environments and particular furnishings or special customised projects, composed of partitions, workstations, seating, storage and accessories.
Three are the fundamental ingredients that define success and name it: concept, first of all, that preludes the project and that always keeps the result of the product at its highest; office, as an original vision of the world of work, constantly changing and that can not ignore a very personal conception of the profession; international, or that is born and realised in Italy, a ""total made in Italy” place of manufacturing, from which it immediately starts to conquer a cosmopolitan dimension.
In more than 25 years of consolidated activity, IOC has carried out numerous projects and received considerable recognition, structuring its presence above all outside the national territory with operational offices in the USA and the UK. IOC has three manufacturing facilities in Italy that operate in synergy covering the complete production cycle.
today IOC is ready to relaunch its new vision of the contemporary office in the old EU continent.
vision / mission
25 years of young history also corresponds to the emerging life of a next generation that is leading the company towards tomorrow’s challenges. IOC is now ready to embark on a journey of change that develops cross-sectional products to explore new connections between the traditional office world and a freer vision of the profession.
Today’s flexible activities and common areas are now merged with formal needs and private environments, thus producing an increasingly fluid idea of space with a few fixed points complemented by lightweight furniture and modular equipment. The office is an increasingly welcoming place, almost in competition with the home: a new productive place but versatile, customisable, comfortable, like a dress, elegant yet dynamic.
Together with Raffaella Mangiarotti’s artistic direction and Leonardo Sonnoli visual communication, IOC's products open up to this new idea of office, introducing an open and graceful language, intimate and at the same time social. With an idea of post-modern minimalism, soft and not sharp, Raffaella Mangiarotti imagines that the pleasure of the workplace must be more stimulating than the pleasure of working at home.
The new projects complement the existing products, expanding IOC’s offer and refreshing the catalogue. Thanks to a material sensitivity and a chromatic delicacy, the finishes of all the products are revised and updated.
The well-being of the guest at work and the sustainability of a delicate world are the two key themes that lead to the future and also for this reason IOC becomes a true ""project partner"" because today it is no longer enough to be just excellent executors and indispensable suppliers, but the interlocutor must be accompanied in all phases of the service, from project estimating to after-sales satisfaction."

The company was established in 1948 and born out of the intuition of Alberto Minotti. The small scale artisan workshop grew quickly and, starting from the Sixties, became more industrialized in character and size. The next step was taken by Renato and Roberto Minotti, who, after the premature death of their father in 1991, took over the reins of the company and began a process of growth and expansion into the international markets. Responsible for the corporate strategy, since 1998 they have shared their creative vision and aesthetic key-principles with the architect Rodolfo Dordoni, who has been assigned the strategic role of coordinator of all the company collections. Central to the Minotti identity is the full expression of the “Made in Italy” concept, which today permanently melds tradition and innovation: the skills of talented artisan are employed to finish a product created by modern technologies, while the intelligence of the hands balances industrial precision with sensitivity and emotion. This high degree of know-how is constantly improved by the intensive research on materials and technological solutions thus enhancing the value of impeccable details. The commitment to excellence involves all the company. Over the years the company has conceived a specific “Minotti code”, that has become a constant feature of every collection, always following the key principle of “innovation in the spirit of continuity”. Deeply rooted in the company's DNA, it is linked to the principles of aesthetic understatement, timeless elegance, continuity in the sign of tradition, artisan savoir-faire with great attention to sartorial details. A key role in this process is played by Minotti Studio, heart and mind of the company, that encapsulates all the skills of the crative supply chain, from architecture to interior design, from prototyping to engineering, from graphics to visual, from marketing to communication. Minotti Studio gives shape to designers' ideas and projects, channeling their creative energies based on different cultural roots, in the development of indoor and outdoor collections for the residential and hospitality segments. These collections reflect the Minotti identity as well as the evolution of living habits. The story of the family is moving forward.

A new catalogue and a new advertising campaign on its way. All to recount Cassina’s perspective: avant-gardism, authenticity, excellence and the. The world of Cassina is the story of a farsighted and intuitive company: the first to usher into Italy the era of industrial design in the 1950s, marking the shift from handcraftsmanship to series production. Driven by a pioneering vision, the company has always been ahead of its time, successfully attracting the most talented designers and architects in the making of new shapes, spurred on by the many inspirations and influences of contemporary design. Research, artisanal expertise and technological development come together in the wide range of offerings for the home and large-scale architecture, embracing a philosophy of passion and perfection that unveils its excellence in the production of furniture collections enhanced by high-comfort, essential, versatile and strikingly innovative designs. Continuing its connection between past, present and future, Cassina presents to the world the great classics of the most important architects of the twentieth century, relaunching the icons of modernity in the collections I Maestri and LC, based upon accuracy and total respect for the original projects. The expressions that have traced the history of design from the fifties to the present day live on in the Contemporary collection, where iconic Made in Italy pieces find new interpretations and variations within different environments. And finally, Cassina’s more experimental approach emerges masterfully in the Simon Collezione, comprising some of the most representative objects of the relationship between culture and industry in Italian design. From innovation to icons, Cassina’s values in the homeA philosophy. A concept. A new catalogue and a new advertising campaign on its way.
All to recount Cassina’s perspective: avant-gardism, authenticity, excellence and the combination of technological capacity with skilled handcraftsmanship. In more than 90 years, Cassina’s identity has been built on solid values to express the best of Italian and international design with a clear, recognisable and cultured message.
The Cassina Perspective develops this conscious and futuristic approach with a broad and detailed panorama of configurations for the home where innovative products and Modern icons come together to create complete and, above all, welcoming environments, dialoguing according to a unique design code based on excellence.Cassina Milan, a perspectival cornerstone interpreted by Patricia UrquiolaDuring the Milan Design Week, the Cassina Milan Showroom is the epitome of The Cassina Perspective with an installation curated by the company’s Art Director Patricia Urquiola.
The store windows have been transformed with a blue perspectival grid that envelops part of the showroom, both on the floor and partially on the walls. In this area the first two living situations feature the new collections by Rodolfo Dordoni on one side and Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec on the other.
A large screen, like a theatrical setting, closes the first part of the window area with a drawing by Le Corbusier created for Chandigarh, the Indian city that he conceived between 1951 and 1956 where Cassina is supporting a research to better understand the origins of this architectural project. Developed in 3D, this drawing is the background from which four videos come to life to tell the story of the embracing Back-Wing armchair by Patricia Urquiola, the CAB family by Mario Bellini, the Cotone sofas by the Bouroullec brothers and the elegant Dress-Up! sofa by Rodolfo Dordoni.
Digital lives in a physical reality, together with the products, in a ‘perspectives’ of concepts.The grid continues and accompanies the visitor to the central area where a ‘diorama’ has been created, that is a scenography that develops in a circular space that corresponds with the sculptural staircase and dome. This panorama is inspired by the homes photographed for the new catalogue where new products are mixed together in everyday situations enriched by the Cassina icons. Depending on one’s position, from the living room to the dining room, the visitors’ perspective constantly changes.Going up into the dome the CAB chair by Mario Bellini is the subject of a graphic installation that highlights the evolution of this icon. XL, Baby, faded ... the family is expanding. Divided into four sections, this space enhances the new saddle leather collection.While in the Sala delle Colonne, at the back of the showroom, an ambience from Chandigarh has been recreated to present four new products developed by the Cassina Research and Development Centre as a Hommage à Pierre Jeanneret: a chair, a chair with armrests, an armchair and a table. This project testimonies the company’s desire for research, to explore the works of the great architects and convert their knowledge into contemporary products.The surrounding rooms on the other hand reconstruct real settings photographed for the new catalogue where complete living and dining areas are presented in rooms with wooden boiserie and marble floors and a fine selection by Federica Sala/PS of contemporary artworks that are available for purchase. To give further value to the complete settings that Cassina is able to offer, an area has been reserved for the Danish company Karakter which became part of the group in March of this year. Thanks to the shared passion for innovative contemporary design and the expertise in reissuing authentic classics, the brand will work in close contact with Cassina. Cassina Runway, unique pieces only for design weekA unique opportunity direct from the catwalk enters the design world for the first time. A selection of upholstered products, both new pieces and bestsellers, has been developed by Cassina with special finishes that are only available for purchase in the exhibited configurations during design week, or subsequently through retailers who order them at this time. From the Cotone small armchairs by Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec in Atom, one of the three new fabrics from the Kvadrat/Raf Simons collection presented at the Salone del Mobile 2019, to the Tre Pezzi armchair by Franco Albini interpreted by Cassina with a gold frame and light blue mohair upholstery.“This year in via Durini we wanted to develop the space through a perspectival grid, in an almost conceptual way. This grid houses the window area and expands towards a digital background. Going beyond this main area of the showroom we come across a circular exhibit space connected to the dome above and inspired by a diorama. We like this idea of rotating space that is open to further narratives that live in the radial areas. The Cassina Perspective is a play on perspectives, meetings and conversations between products, a shared space between heritage and innovation which embraces Cassina’s energy.”"
31,FLEXFORM SPA,695310961,Monza e della Brianza,Lombardia,69679810,Sistema ARREDAMENTO,grande,"The Groundpiece sofa, designed by Antonio Citterio in 2001, is known for its design that transcends the bounds of time and fashion, and its unrivaled comfort. Watch the video of the new ad campaign.FLEXFORM’s history is a family history. Now at the third generation, FLEXFORM was founded in the furniture manufacturing district of Brianza, in Northern Italy. This is where the unique worldwide phenomenon of design Made in Italy began, in the 1960s. A territory where the history of many small crafts workshops working with wood, metal and upholstery since the early 1900s intertwines with that of the great masters of Italian design, trained in the School of Architecture in nearby Milan. The FLEXFORM story is part of this historical context. In 1959 the Galimberti brothers started a crafts workshop, which they called “Flexform di Galimberti.” They opened their first streetfront showroom, displaying sofas and armchairs that found their way, in the postwar era, into elegant buildings in Milan, villas overlooking Lake Como, and even the foyer of Teatro alla Scala. Their sons transformed the workshop into an industrial facility, and in 1967 FLEXFORM became a joint-stock company. Intuition prompted the family to work with the leading designers of the time: Joe Colombo, Asnago-Vender, Cini Boeri, Rodolfo Bonetto and many others. With the young architect Antonio Citterio, during those same years FLEXFORM embarked on a path of professional growth that has continued without interruption to the present, for over forty years. The decade of the 1970s marks a decisive turning point in the firm’s conception of products. Avoiding repetition of past styles, the production became increasingly original and contemporary. “The family is a great value, an important legacy of resources, stimuli, knowledge. Roots allow us to look to the future. Without awareness of our history we cannot imagine future scenarios. It is true that only he who knows where he comes from can know where he is heading. It is an honor and a commitment for all of us in the third generation to continue the work of our predecessors. To keep alive what we like to call the “we attitude,” i.e. the awareness that it is the team – and therefore the brand – that is the real player, not the individual. No soloists, but a group that thinks in the first-person plural, never the singular. The challenge is to keep intact that “expedition behavior” – to use a term borrowed from Jeff Ashby, the Space Shuttle commander – namely the altruistic and generous behavior typical of mountain climbing expeditions, where valuing the team above all other concerns is the key to success. So continuing to think in collective terms for the benefit of the brand is the most important challenge for our family business.” In the 1970s the family understood the importance of exploring new markets, beyond the national borders. They approached Europe, where the German-speaking countries, in particular, demonstrated great interest in their understated, elegant and comfortable sofas, especially in Germany. Overses growth was also constant and unstoppable, as Flexform gained visibility in the most exclusive furniture stores in America, Asia and Australia. With the advent of the new millennium, the company launched a program of internationalization through the opening of exclusive FLEXFORM flagship stores. Sustainability Fabrics, leathers, woods and metals are selected according to the highest quality standards, also with a criterion of sustainable proximity to the company. The goosedown utilized – for the large, soft cushions that are FLEXFORM’s stylistic trademark - has Assopiuma Gold Certification, guaranteeing maximum quality of raw materials and manufacturing processes. Respect for the environment, processes and the animals themselves is ensured by this certification. The durability of products is a crucial value of environmental sustainability. Long-lasting things lead to less waste and pollution, not generating material for disposal, requiring transport and resulting emissions of CO2. FLEXFORM products, crafted te best materials and the most advanced manufacturing techniques, are made to last in time. ""Clients sometimes ask us to replace the covering of a sofa more than twenty years after its purchase. The structure is still solid. And the image never goes out of style."" FLEXFORM believes in the development of projects with an outlook of Corporate Social Responsibility. One example is the partnership with Porsche Italia in the project Porsche “Ex Machina” supported by H-Farm, the leading Italian start-up incubator aimed at young talents 3.0. Invited to work on the development of digital projects to apply to the corporate business, FLEXFORM has supported this operation aimed at giving a concrete opportunity to the younger generations, fostering trust and promoting the culture of merit. Image and communication
The way a story is told can make it an interesting or a boring tale. The story of FLEXFORM was born under a lucky star. The company immediately understood the importance of image and communication, and in 1969 they assigned the design of a logo to Pino Tovaglia, a visionary creative spirit, graphic designer and architect (also creator of the logos of Pirelli and Alfa Romeo). Tovaglia proposed the name FLEXFORM – a contraction of Flexible Forms – going against the trend in the furniture industry of using family surnames. The first ad campaigns appeared in magazines. These were the years when Andy Warhol and Studio 54 were inspiring creative talents around the world, and this was the spirit behind the images, colors, forms and positive energy that filled the FLEXFORM brochures, catalogues and ad campaigns. Starting in the 1980s, for many years the narration of the elegant world of FLEXFORM, under the art direction of Natalia Corbetta, shifted towards the intense expressive impact of chiaroscuro black and white photographs in the advertising, all made by outstanding photographers. Stripped down of everything except the emotions, the shots of the great masters of photography – Aldo Ballo, Gabriele Basilico, Gianni Berengo Gardin, Giovanni Gastel, Gian Paolo Barbieri, Maria Vittoria Backhaus, Mario Ciampi, Fabrizio Ferri – traced the contours of a unique, original narrative dimension. Today FLEXFORM is shifting the brand’s narration from the quality of production to quality of life. From the product to the experience of the product. In short, “to turn a house into a home” is the sentiment the company wants to share with its audience. A totally updated range of channels that work in unison - print campaign, video, social networks, website, catalogues, trade fairs - contributes to convey the correct perception of the brand, to reach an ever wider, varied and international audience. The slogan Home at Last that guides all the communication today is a message that sums up the value of homecoming, as the arrival point of our day, but also the home seen as the dream of a lifetime. “The design of a private home is the design of the client’s dream of a lifetime.”   Antonio CitterioWith the introduction of color in the photographs and of the Home at Last concept, the company creates worlds of meaning with which anyone can identify in terms of affinities and the sharing of places, situations, sensations, through storytelling that establishes a relationship with the public. The construction of high aesthetic impact of images is thus joined by the value of its meaning. The focus is on clients and their life experiences. “We are working in continuity with the past, keeping the quality level of our communication very high. We continue to work with photographers known for their images of great intensity in our advertising campaigns, creative talents used to thinking glocally, directors capable of bringing emotions to our audience, transmitting our brand values in videos. Our brand belongs to the sphere of desirability, and the ability to tell stories is undoubtedly the proving ground of the future of communication.”"
